## About

ReflectOS is the approachable, configurable, and extensible OS for your smart mirror project.  It is designed to allow anyone to easily install, customize, and enjoy a smart mirror/display - no coding or command line usage required!  Instructions for installing on your device and more details about ReflectOS can be found on the [ReflectOS Firmware](https://github.com/Reflect-OS/firmware) project.

This package provides the set of sections, layouts, and layout managers which ship with the prebuilt ReflectOS Firmware.  

For more information on what these are, refer to the [ReflectOS Firmware](https://github.com/Reflect-OS/firmware) documentation.

If you are interested in building your own extensions for ReflectOS, 
please see the documentation for the [ReflectOS Kernel](https://hexdocs.pm/reflect_os_kernel) library.
